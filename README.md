This project is a front-end clone of the Amazon homepage built using HTML and CSS. It replicates the visual structure and layout of the Amazon website, including the top navigation bar, search bar, category menu, hero section with a promotional banner, product showcase boxes, and footer. The layout is styled entirely using custom CSS and includes responsive design techniques and icon integration using Font Awesome. This project was created for educational purposes to practice HTML/CSS structuring, layout design, and styling, and does not include any backend functionality or real-time interactivity.
